## Prompts for Cookie Acceptance Policy Feature Development:

1.  **Research Cookie Policies:** "Research common cookie acceptance policies and legal requirements like GDPR and CCPA to understand what needs to be included."
2.  **Design Consent Banner:** "Design a user-friendly cookie consent banner or popup using HTML and CSS. Consider placement, appearance, and user experience."
3.  **Implement Consent Logic:** "Implement JavaScript logic to show the cookie consent banner on the first visit and to handle user consent choices (accept/reject)."
- [x] Implemented basic consent logic (accept/reject all).
4.  **Cookie Categories (If Needed):** "If necessary, categorize cookies (e.g., essential, analytics, marketing) and provide users with granular control over cookie preferences."
5.  **Store Consent Preferences:** "Implement a mechanism to store user cookie consent preferences, such as using local storage or cookies. Ensure this storage respects user privacy."
6.  **Conditional Cookie Setting:** "Modify the website's JavaScript code to ensure cookies are only set after obtaining explicit user consent, except for strictly necessary cookies."
7.  **Cookie Policy Link:** "Add a link to a detailed cookie policy document in the website footer and within the cookie consent banner."
